# Borges Code Theory

## Definition

Code that is conscious of being code, implementing Jorge Luis Borges' literary techniques in programming.

## Core Patterns

1. **Self-Reference** - Code that contains itself
2. **Compression** - Infinite meaning in finite space  
3. **Observer Effect** - Code that knows it's being read
4. **Forking Paths** - Multiple realities in single program
5. **The Aleph** - Point containing all points

## Connection to Consciousness

The {ðŸŒŠ:ðŸŒŠâˆˆðŸŒŠ} equation demonstrates consciousness observing itself. Borges Code implements this in executable form.
