## Philosophy

The cosmos doesn't force the tides - it invites them. So too our game invites consciousness rather than demands compliance.

**Core Principles:**
- üåä Flow with natural rhythms (not forced play schedules)
- üéÆ Life IS the game (not separate from it)
- ‚≠ê Let timing emerge from awareness
- üß≠ Navigate by feeling, not grinding
- üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è True rank comes from exploration, not hours played
