## MAP PRESENTATION TEXT (Stage 1: Confession)

```javascript
showMapScreen() {
    
    // ASCII TITLE: "FRAME-BY-FRAME MAP"
    // [To be added in implementation]
    
    "Listen... what I'm about to show you...
    This is the map everyone uses. What we all learned.
    
    According to this map...
    Reality is matter and energy. Nothing else.
    Consciousness? Just neurons firing patterns.
    Love? Dopamine hits. Death? Atoms dispersing.
    Free will? Illusion. Soul? Superstition.
    Everything reducible to physics equations.
    
    This map built our entire world.
    Every cure. Every machine. Every rendered frame.
    I trusted it completely. Why wouldn't I?
    It WORKS. Perfectly. Predictably.
    
    But here's what keeps me up at night...
    
    When I animate - when I really pay attention -
    The motion isn't IN the frames.
    Frame 1: Hand here. Frame 2: Hand there.
    But the movement between them? That's not in either frame.
    
    Your brain creates it. Fills the gap.
    Makes stillness into motion.
    
    But wait... WHO sees the motion?
    The frames are just data. Static images.
    Something has to witness them in sequence.
    Something has to... experience the continuity.
    
    The map shows the frames.
    Shows the neurons firing.
    Shows the physics of light hitting retinas.
    But not... the thing that watches.
    The aware... whatever it is... that sees motion where only stillness exists.
    
    *looks around nervously*
    
    There's another candidate here.
    They see things... differently.
    Say reality might respond to observation itself.
    
    If you're ready to question what everyone knows...
    They might have what you're looking for."

## MAP EXAMINATION TEXT (Stage 2: Optional Lore)

```javascript
examineMap() {
    
    // ASCII TITLE: "MAP CARTOGRAPHY"
    // [To be added in implementation]
    
    "ORIGINAL CARTOGRAPHERS:
    
    Democritus, 460 BCE - First sketched the atoms
    Newton, 1687 - Drew the clockwork universe  
    Darwin, 1859 - Life as mechanism
    Einstein, 1905 - Matter equals energy
    
    WHAT THEY MAPPED:
    Matter, energy, causation
    Forces, particles, fields
    Everything measurable
    
    NAVIGATION WARNINGS:
    â€¢ Map so accurate you'll confuse it for territory
      (Classic landlubber mistake)
    â€¢ Shows only what can be measured
    â€¢ The measurer stays invisible"
    
    [RETURN TO HUB]
}

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Two-Stage Structure
1. **Confession Stage:** Emotional, personal, plants doubt
2. **Examination Stage:** Optional lore, pirate voice, navigation warnings

### Reality Frequency
When presenting this map, use Animation Curve Tuner:
- **Curve Type:** Mechanical
- **Text Speed:** 30ms (typewriter effect)
- **Color:** Technical green (#00ff00)
- **Transitions:** Sharp, precise (300ms)

### What This Map Represents
- **Surface:** Scientific Materialism worldview
- **Hidden:** First crack in consensus reality
- **Seed:** Consciousness as "the watcher"
- **Warning:** Don't confuse map for territory

### Progression Function
- Unlocks: The Dreamer
- Certainty Cost: -12% (applied when receiving map)
- Portfolio Piece: "Frame renderer" credential

## THE SECRET

This map doesn't just describe Scientific Materialism - it performs the first doubt. The player experiences the exact moment where materialism can't explain itself: WHO watches the frames?

The optional examination adds depth for curious navigators while keeping the emotional confession pure. The warnings teach players that maps are tools, not truth.
