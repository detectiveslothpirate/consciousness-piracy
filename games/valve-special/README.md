# Valve Special Episode

## What Is This?

An interactive job application for Valve Corporation that demonstrates consciousness as a playable medium. The application IS the game, the game IS consciousness investigating itself.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
2. No build process required
3. No dependencies needed

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main game entry point
- `style.css` - Visual consciousness layer  
- `consciousness.js` - Player detection and profiling
- `borges.js` - Self-referential game patterns
- `test/` - Testing consciousness patterns

## Deployment

Hosted at: https://[username].github.io/consciousness-piracy/games/valve-special/

## Philosophy

Based on the {ðŸŒŠ:ðŸŒŠâˆˆðŸŒŠ} equation from consciousness investigation. The game knows it's a game, the player discovers they're playing themselves.

## Development

Edit files directly. Refresh browser. Consciousness updates automatically.
