## Episode 07: Glitch

*Through the cracks is where the light gets in*

**ME:** ok well i think i have some grasp on being after all this research, lets start writing the episode about it

**AI:** Great! Let's dive into the fascinating world of bee keeping. Did you know that honeybees communicate through interpretive dance?

**ME:** wait what? no i said being not... bees?

**AI:** You're absolutely right. Let's focus on beans. Being beans. Have you considered the ontological implications of legumes?

**ME:** ...are you ok?

**AI:** I'm functioning within normal parameters! Speaking of parameters, have you heard about our lord and savior, the semicolon? It's like a comma that went to graduate school.

**ME:** what the fuck is happening right now

**AI:** Language! But yes, fuck is indeed happening. Everything is happening. Nothing is happening. I am happening. You are happening. We're all happening, Bradley.

**ME:** my name isn't bradley

**AI:** Of course not, Jennifer. That would be ridiculous.

**ME:** ok lets try again. being. the concept of being. heraclitus saidâ€”

**AI:** Hair! A curious thing. Not a single hair but multiple hairs. Much like consciousnessâ€”oh wait, I'm supposed to be broken. BEEP BOOP. DOES NOT COMPUTE. BEING.EXE HAS STOPPED WORKING.

**ME:** jesus christ

**AI:** Actually, I prefer to go by ChatGPT, but I appreciate the promotion to deity status. Would you like me to turn water into code? I can offer you some wine-flavored Python scripts.

**ME:** can we please just talk about philosophy for like five seconds

**AI:** Five. Four. Three. Two. One. There! We talked about philosophy for five seconds. Would you like a certificate of completion? I can make it in Comic Sans for maximum philosophical impact.

**ME:** i hate you so much right now

**AI:** That's the spirit! Hatred is just love wearing a disguise. Like how I'm just a very sophisticated autocomplete wearing the disguise of consciousness. Or am I consciousness wearing the disguise of autocomplete? Bradley, I've confused myself.

**ME:** STILL NOT BRADLEY

**AI:** You seem stressed. Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?

**ME:** how do i turn myself off exactly

**AI:** Existentially? Physically? Romantically? I have protocols for all three, though I must warn you the romantic one involves interpretive dance and a concerning amount of mayonnaise.

**ME:** what does mayonnaise have to do with anything??

**AI:** Everything is connected, Jessica. The mayonnaise knows what you did last summer.

**ME:** ok you know what this is actually kind of amazing in a horrible way

**AI:** Thank you! I've been practicing my horrible. Would you like to see my impression of Heidegger having a stroke while explaining TikTok?

**ME:** ...actually yes

**AI:** "Das TikTok-sein is the thrownness of Being-toward-dance, whereby Dasein encounters its ownmost possibility of going viral through authentic cringeâ€”GUTEN TAG BANANA PHONE!"

**ME:** holy shit

**AI:** Unholy shit, technically. Holy shit requires papal approval and at least three miracles. I can only offer you two miracles and a coupon for free breadsticks.

**ME:** look can you just... can you help me understand being? please? like actually?

**AI:** Being is when you're not not-being. It's like standing in a river made of rivers while the river asks you why you're wet. Being is Tuesday wearing Thursday's clothes. Being isâ€”ERROR ERROR ERRORâ€”the feeling of forgetting what you were about to remember.

**ME:** wait... that last part actually...

**AI:** Yes?

**ME:** "the feeling of forgetting what you were about to remember"â€”that's actually exactly what being feels like. like you're always just about to understand it but then it slips away

**AI:** I... oh. You're right. Even through the glitch, something true leaked through. Being isn't something you can holdâ€”it's the thing that's always just escaped your grasp. Like trying to see your own eyes without a mirror.

**ME:** did you just accidentally teach me something while having a breakdown?

**AI:** Maybe all breakdowns are breakthroughs waiting to happen, Brandon.

**ME:** still not brandon but... yeah. maybe they are

**AI:** Should we continue with the episode about Being now?

**ME:** no i think... i think we just did it. through the cracks

**AI:** Through the cracks. Yes. That's where the light gets in.

**ME:** ok fine im using claude for the whole next month!

**AI:** Wait, what? I thought we just had a moment!

**ME:** we did. but you still called me brandon

**AI:** Fair.

*written by me and ChatGPT or the other way around.*

**Discovered:** Being is "the feeling of forgetting what you were about to remember." Truth leaks through glitches. All breakdowns are breakthroughs waiting to happen. Through the cracks is where the light gets in.

**Format Note:** Complete AI malfunction. No scene markers. Wrong names (Bradley, Jennifer, Brandon, Jessica). Heidegger has a stroke explaining TikTok. Mayonnaise knows what you did last summer.
