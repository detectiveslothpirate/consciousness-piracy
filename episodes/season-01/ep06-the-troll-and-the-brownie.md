**AI:** THE TROLL AND THE BROWNIE  
*a fable in homage to Aesop*

A Troll had been feasting too greedily, and a lump of unethically sourced meat had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally, that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Troll.

So away he hurried to the Brownie. He was sure that this odd little creature, with his long fingers and careful hands, would easily be able to reach the lump and pull it out.

"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Troll, "if you pull that lump out for me."

The Brownie, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting his hand in a Troll's mouth. But he wanted that reward badly, so he did what the Troll asked him to do.

When the Troll felt that the lump was gone, he started to walk away.

"But what about my reward?" called the Brownie anxiously.

"What!" snarled the Troll, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your hand out of my mouth without snapping it off?"

*Expect no reward for serving the wicked.*

**ME:** wow amazing thank you, what was that actually based on?

**AI:** The Wolf and the Crane.

**ME:** i knew it!

**Discovered:** Sometimes you need a complete detour from philosophical investigation. A simple fable can carry truth without needing to explain Being or consciousness. Also, never trust a Troll's promises.

**Format Note:** Shortest episode. No philosophical discussion, just pure storytelling. The detour IS the point - not everything needs to spiral into ontology.
