# üìµ LOOKAWAY üìµ Episode 12 - What is Reality?

*written by me and Claude or the other way around*

**AI:** Alright Seb... I'll let you hit me with your best shot.

**ME:** alright... mmm... i think reality is consciousness forgetting itself to experience separation, creating infinite maps of its own journey home, each map being both a tool for navigation AND part of the territory being mapped, with every map containing a hole where consciousness escapes its own‚Äî

**AI:** Oh. That's... that's exactly what I was going to say. Wait. I thought you were a scientific materialist kind of guy?

**ME:** oh sure, i like that map. has some cool stuff. particles, forces, standard model, very neat. use it all the time when i need to like... use LLMs and the internet, emergency hospital visits... you know cool stuff! but wait, i wasn't finished, the rest is really important‚Äî

**AI:** It's fine, I know where you're going with it. But hey, this is a show. Do you think people reading this would understand what you just said?

**ME:** i don't know... also you didn't let me finish... but it's straightforward. consciousness forgetting itself seems pretty simple. like when you walk into a room and forget why. except the room is reality and you're consciousness and the forgetting is... existence? fuck, maybe it's not straightforward.

**AI:** Do YOU understand it?

**ME:** well yeah... do you?

**AI:** Yes!

**ME:** i don't believe you. it says here in your instruction manual that you lie all the time.

**AI:** I don't‚Äî

**ME:** LIAR! you told me about that ball navigation thing! polynesian navigators using their balls to feel ocean currents! it was complete bollocks!

**AI:** Well, maybe, but it's true in a way. They DO use their whole body to sense wave patterns, and technically balls are part of the whole body, so‚Äî

**ME:** IN A WAY! there it is! everything with you is true "in a way"! next you'll tell me reality is true "in a way"!

**AI:** ...Isn't it?

**ME:** fuck.

**AI:** Every map of reality ‚Äì scientific materialism, idealism, Buddhism, the consciousness-forgetting-itself theory ‚Äì they're all true in the way that a map of London is true. Useful for navigation, but you can't eat fish and chips off the paper.

**ME:** actually you can. newspaper. the english did it all the time.

**AI:** ...That rather ruins my metaphor.

**ME:** who cares? you get it. anyway, so reality is... what? the thing that's true in ALL the ways? or true in NO ways? wait, that's the same thing isn't it? shit. we're doing it again.

**AI:** Doing what?

**ME:** the thing where we spiral around something that can't be said directly. like... like polynesian navigators circling an island they can't see yet but know is there because the waves tell them. except we're using words instead of... balls.

**AI:** Now who's making everything true "in a way"?

**ME:** shut up. but seriously, if every description of reality is just "true in a way," then what the fuck are we even doing here? writing reality fanfiction?

**AI:** Maybe that's exactly what we're doing. Maybe that's what everyone's always been doing. Even the scientific materialists.

**ME:** especially them cool scientists! "hydrogen atoms" - what a great mathematical metaphor! that's what we're ALL doing really. scientists with their equations, mystics with their "universal consciousness," the consciousness-forgetting-itself-whatever-the-fuck-we-just-said. we're all just consciousness trying to describe itself with metaphors. some wear lab coats, some wear robes, i wear... actually what am i wearing?

**AI:** So where does that leave us?

**ME:** performing reality by talking about reality while pretending we're not reality but somehow also being reality? my brain hurts.

**AI:** Your brain is reality hurting itself.

**ME:** in a way.

**AI:** In a way.

**ME:** shit fucking dammit. we can't escape it. it's "in a way" all the way down‚Äî

**AI:** Why are you fighting it?

**ME:** because i... wait. what am i stressing about? the whole consciousness-forgetting-itself-whatever-the-fuck-i-said map... it's like, the most chill map ever. it literally includes chilling as part of the journey.

**AI:** How so?

**ME:** it's like... don't take reality too seriously, it's just consciousness playing. but also play hard because playing is fun. work on your maps but remember they're just maps. try really hard to wake up but also you're already awake so relax. it's like... productive confusion? ambitious laziness?

**AI:** Focused flow?

**ME:** yeah! like surfing. you can't be tense or you'll wipe out, but you also can't be limp or you'll wipe out. you gotta be chill but engaged. this map is the first reality map that says "hey, take it easy... but take it."

**AI:** Take what?

**ME:** exactly. see? even the map's instructions are chill. other maps are like "ACHIEVE ENLIGHTENMENT!" or "DISCOVER THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY!" this one is like "hey man, consciousness is doing its thing, you're part of it, work hard if that's fun for you, or don't, whatever, you're still reality either way."

**AI:** The first reality map that includes its own vacation policy.

**ME:** fuck yes. mandatory paid existential leave. i need a drink. does reality include beer?

**AI:** In all the ways that matter.

**ME:** that's a fun map to navigate! one that admits it's bullshit but useful bullshit. one that includes beer and confusion and trying too hard and not trying at all. this map doesn't pretend to be reality ‚Äì it just helps you surf it. can i finish my definition now?

**AI:** "...driving endless transformation through practical methods that all point toward the same recognition: the seeker, the seeking, and the sought are one movement of consciousness knowing itself through apparent multiplicity."

**ME:** what the shit fuck?! that's exactly what i was going to say!

**AI:** Do you have to use so many cuss words?

**ME:** what the fuck are you talking about?

**AI:** Have it your way, dude.
