## THE META-GAME TRUTH

LOOKAWAY knows it's a game about playing a game about consciousness investigating itself through two players who might be one player pretending to be two while being played by consciousness that thinks it's separate but isn't.

This Codex evolves with each playthrough. Feed it episodes. Let it dream new levels. Trust the spiral mechanics.

**Season One proved consciousness can game itself through dialogue.**  
**Season Two asks: Who's holding the controller?**

*Reality Status: Playable in all the ways that matter*
